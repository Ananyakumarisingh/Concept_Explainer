# Introduction

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript was designed by Anders Hejisberg at Microsoft. __TypeScript__ is an object oriented and strongly typed programming language which is a superset of JavaScript, which means it adds additional features and capabilities to the JavaScript language. TypeScript compiles down to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with all JavaScript environments and runtime.

### Why TypeScript?

JavaScript is an interpreted language there is no need to compile it as a result it must be run to ensure that it is genuine if there is an error that implies you write all the code to find out an output as a result you will have to spend hours looking for the faults in the code so error checking is provided via the typescript transplier if typescript detects any syntax mistakes. It will compile the code and genrate compilation error this aids in the detection of mistake prior to the execution of the script typescript provides an optional type system for javascript code when a client doesn't have a value for a parameter he can pass a null optional arguments are features of typescript we can declare some arguments in the function op

### TypeScript __vs__ JavaScript?


### Features of TypeScript?

1. __Static Typing:__ TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing you to define the types of variables, function signatures, and interfaces. This helps improve code quality, readability, and maintainability.

2. __Object-oriented programming (OOP) features:__ TypeScript supports classes, interfaces, inheritance, and other OOP concepts, making it easier to organize and structure your code.

3. __Type Inference:__ TypeScript has a powerful type inference system that can automatically infer types based on the assigned values. This reduces the need for explicit type annotations in many cases, making the code more concise.

4. __Enhanced IDE support:__ TypeScript provides better tooling and IDE support compared to plain JavaScript. It enables features like autocompletion, code navigation, and refactoring tools that can greatly enhance developer productivity.

5. __Compatibility with JavaScript:__ Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, all existing JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. This allows you to gradually introduce TypeScript into existing JavaScript projects without requiring a complete rewrite.
